# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation




## Description
This project aims to perform customer segmentation for e-commerce companies by analyzing transaction data and customer behaviors. By leveraging unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques, we will cluster customers based on purchasing patterns, demographic information, and behavioral metrics. This segmentation will provide insights into customer groups, enabling personalized marketing, enhanced user experiences, and improved customer retention strategies. The project will include visualizations to explore customers.
